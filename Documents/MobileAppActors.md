## General Description of User:
A user would use the app to collect information about this initiative, browse galleries, like, share, or filter artwork within them, to enhance their creativity or have fun using the drawing features the app provides,
or to find redirects to the website where our logic centre is. They could share drawings they've made through the drawing menu, post them to facebook or other social media, or directly to our public gallery.
Users would not apply or post images directly to the promotional gallery through the app. They would be redirected to the website in order to achieve these goals.

## Use Cases:
Open the App - Opening the app will direct the user immediately to the "Galleries" section (1st option on the top menubar inside the app). The menubar would be visible all the time and thus users could navigate to
different tabs.

Go to Galleries - When a user navigated to another tab using the top menubar, they could navigate back to the "Galleries" section by tapping the corresponding button on the menubar.

Select Gallery - Once a user is inside the "Galleries" section, they could pick from 2 galleries - "Public Gallery" and "Promotional Gallery". Both galleries would have the same features inside the app
(liking, filtering), but posting to the "Promotional Gallery" could only be done by the admin (the admin would accept artwork from artists only through the website).

Like Images - Regardless of which gallery the user is in, they could like any artwork they find. Liking could use different emoticions like Facebook does (thumbs-up, happy emoji, hearts emoji, impressed emoji).

Share Images - Regardless of gallery selection, artwork could be shared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest.

Filter Images - Regardless of gallery selection, artwork could be filtered. Filtering could happen based on: amount of likes (for simplicity, all emoji types count towards number of likes), amount of shares,
recently posted.

Go to Drawing Screen - Users could navigate to the "Drawing Screen" from the top menubar by tapping the corresponding button. The "Drawing Screen" hosts several features to facilitate drawing on digital prosthetics.

Select Canvas - For each new session, the "Drawing Screen" would force the user to select a canvas. Canvas selection could be a pop-up, and would allow the creation of a blank/new canvas or the selection of one that's
already been worked on (loading feature).

Draw - Drawing would happen with a default brush given to the user. Holding down on the canvas would paint with the selected brush and color.

Tap Drawing Options Menu - By tapping this button, a few additional "bubbles" pop-up on the screen. These are additional options such as, selecting another canvas, undoing changes, redoing changes, sharing on
social media, or saving to device.

Select Another Canvas - Pop-up from the "Drawing Options Menu", facilitates canvas selection. Users can pick another one of their saved canvases or create a blank one for a new artwork.

Undo - Another pop-up from the "Drawing Options Menu", facilitates undoing your previous changes. Can support up to X number of previous changes.

Redo - Another pop-up from the "Drawing Options Menu", facilitates redoing your previous changes. Again, can support up to X number of changes.

Select From Right-hand Side Menu - Apart from the "Drawing Options Menu", users can interact with additional buttons on the right-hand side. These would hold features such as: color selection, brush selection and
modification, eraser selection and modification, open color palette, save canvas.

Select Color - Tapping the "Select Color" button would open a color picker where users could define the details of the colur they would like to use. This color picker could have another feature "Add color to palette"
which would allow them to save colors to their selected palette.

Change Color - Tapping the "Select Color" button again, would open the color picker again, and would allow users to alter the color they have selected. (Could be the same use case to be honest).

Add Color to Palette - Tapping the "Select Color" button again, would allow users to add a selected color to any of the color palettes they have or to a new 'unsaved palette' -> this would be their way of creating a new
palette.

Select Brush - Tapping the "Select Brush" button, would open a brush selector. It could have 'templated brushes', like: smooth brush, hard brush, thick brush, thin brush, but would also host a small interface so
users can alter brush behaviour.

Change Brush Behaviour - Tapping the "Select Brush" button, would open the brush selector again, but the small interface would allow users to alter their brush behaviour.
(This could be an overlap with the Select Brush use case).

Select Color from Palette - Tapping the "Color Palettes" button, would open an interface hosting saved palettes and the collection of colors inside them. Users could pick a palette they have previously saved and/or
pick a color from the current color palette. Holding down on a color in the collection of the current palette would open a pop-up where the user could "Change or Remove" the current color. Changing would open the same
color picker as "Select Color" button would, and would allow the user to change the currently picked color inside the palette while also saving their changes.

Remove Color from Palette - Selecting a color palette in the "Color Palettes" window, and holding down on a color in the color collection of the current palette, would open a pop-up asking if you'd like to
change or remove the selected color from the palette. Tapping "Remove" would give the user a "Yes/No" question. Selecting yes, would remove the color from the current color palette and wouldsave the palette
automatically.

Save Palette - The "Color Palettes" section would also host a button to save a color palette.

Load Palette - The "Color Palettes" section would allow the user to pick from a list of color palettes they have previously saved.

Delete Palette - Tapping and then holding on a "Color Palette" will prompt the user if they want to delete the selected palette.

Save Canvas - Another option on the "Right-hand Side Menu", would be saving the canvas the user is working on. Tapping this would save all unsaved changes to the current canvas.

Go to Info Page - Tapping "Info" at the top navigation bar, would direct the user to the "Info Page" where they could find several redirects and contact information. This includes: redirect to website's homepage,
website's contact page, to social media pages (if this initiative has social media pages, it would be nice to have them here), and finally, a redirect to the artist application form on the website.
