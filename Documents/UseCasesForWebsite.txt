- When a company wants to donate a prostetic , also a form is filled in.

Artist - Apply to be part of this project so the artist can paint a prostetic.
An artist could use this website for the same reasons as a regular user, but also the artist can fill in a form and send two pictures of art the artist make so the admin can look if the artist is good enough to 
paint a prostetic for a amputee or for the fun raising. 

Admin - Manage Galleries. Manage request for artist or request from a amputee
An admin would use this website to manage the open gallery, accept  or decline incoming pictures that people want to post to the promotional gallery (kind of a moderator role), and they could also manage artists as well.
- an artist wants to apply to become a "Professional Artist" on the site/app, an admin could have the power to grant this right to a given user or not (depending on their artwork and trustworthiness).
- Managing reques from a amputee means that  the admin sees the request and checked with a company who makes the prostetics if this is a real request. Also the admin sends a messages if the amputee or artist is chosen
to be a part of this project or that the request is declined.
- When a artist applies to be a part of the project, the admin looks if this is a proffesional artist and if the artist is good enough for this project.
