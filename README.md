# Painted-Prosthetics
## Our mission
### The problem
The cheapest prosthetic of a leg costs 5000$, some being as expensive as a house! Our goal is to raise awareness that a lot of people cannot afford that and we need to help them!
### How can we help?
Through raising awareness, we want to gather donations. Donations would be used for buying sockets for leg prosthetics or prosthetics themselves. To cheer amputees, they would be allowed to pick any artwork they want on a socket and artist would draw on it.
A website and a drawing app will be used to automate amputees requests for donations; donation offers across companies and individuals.
